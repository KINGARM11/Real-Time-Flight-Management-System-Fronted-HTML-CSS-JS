        <p>These Terms and Conditions govern the 6E Rewards Program with effect from February 2020 and apply to the
            relationship between you (being a Member,or prospective Member, of the 6E Rewards Program, and terms such as
            ‘you’ and ‘your/s’ shall be construed accordingly) and InterGlobe Aviation Limited (“us” / “IndiGo”), and
            are intended to protect both you and us. It is your responsibility to read and understand them before you
            start using the 6E Rewards membership. This contains important information about your rights and
            obligations, as well as limitations and exclusions that may apply. Some of the clauses may be related to
            other clauses, and therefore we recommend that no clause be read in isolation. Usage of your Co-branded Card

                    cancellation of Membership. Any such cancellation or termination does not relieve the Member of any
                    continuing obligations under these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                <p>15.4 IndiGo may, at its own discretion, charge an annual maintenance fee to manage the 6E Rewards
